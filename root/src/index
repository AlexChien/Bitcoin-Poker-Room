<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Bitcoin Poker Room is intended as a place where poker fans can play
with their friends for free.</p>

<p>In order to keep the game fair we decided to leverage digital virtual
currency Bitcoin. Essentially, after you download Bitcoin client program
you can generate "coins" which later you can spend in this poker room.</p>

<p>Since generation of "coins" depends on the amount of time spent generating them
we effectively eliminate bad players who disturb game. For example, it's no
longer possible for someone to enter a game, go All-in in the first round
and, once lost everything, re-register a new account and repeat it all over.</p>

<p>You can download Bitcoin client software for bitcoins generation from
<a href="http://www.bitcoin.org" target="_blank">http://www.bitcoin.org</a></p>

<p>We do not collect any information about players, except for user name, password
and, optionally, an email.</p>

<p>We are trying to make this poker room work through Tor as well, but keep in
mind, that Tor sometimes drops connection and it is possible that poker room will
become unstable.</p>
