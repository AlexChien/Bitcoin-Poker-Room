  <p>Bitcoin Poker Room is intended as a place where poker fans can play
  with their friends for free.</p>

  <p><img width="650" src='/static/img/bitcoinpokertable2.png' /></p>

  <p>In order to keep the game fair we decided to leverage digital virtual
  currency Bitcoin. Bitcoins are "mined" by people running bitcoins generation software.
  It's very hard to generate one bitcoin today, therefore you may consider to buy them
  from people who generate them.</p>

  <p>Since generation of "coins" depends on the amount of time spent generating them
  we effectively eliminate bad players who disturb game. For example, it's no
  longer possible for someone to enter a game, go All-in in the first round
  and, once lost everything, re-register a new account and repeat it all over.</p>

  <p>You can download Bitcoin client software for bitcoins generation from
  <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org" target="_blank">http://www.bitcoin.org</a></p>

  <p>We do not collect any information about players, except for user name, password
  and, optionally, an email.</p>

  <p>We are trying to make this poker room work through Tor as well, but keep in
  mind, that Tor sometimes drops connection and it is possible that poker room will
  become unstable.</p>

  <p>This project is fully open source under AGPLv3+ (server code) and
  GPLv3+ (html/css/js code) licenses. You can download the latest version following
  "Download sources" in the footer links.</p>

  <p>Also, we really appreciate any bug reports. Please, follow the link "Report bugs"
  in the footer to report a bug in the room.</p>

  <p>Any suggestions are also welcome. Please, send any questions, suggestions,
  etc to <a href="mailto:pavel@yepcorp.com">pavel@yepcorp.com</a></p>
