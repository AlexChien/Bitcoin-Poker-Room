<p>We accept only Bitcoins as deposit option. If you want to know more - checkout <a href='http://www.bitcoin.org' target='_blank'>http://www.bitcoin.org</a></p>

<p>We have generated address for all your transactions. Any money sent to this address will be deposited to your account. Please note, that we wait untill we get atleast one confirmation of the transaction, so it will take some time for sent bitcoins to appear here. This delay depends on network size and load at this moment.</p>
